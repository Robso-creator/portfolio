# Challenges and Learnings of a Junior Data Engineer: A Real Journey

Hey everyone! Today I want to share something really honest about my life as a junior data engineer. You know that idea that everything is perfect in the first years of your career? Well, the reality is quite different.

## The Challenges No One Talks About

When I started, I thought I would just arrive and "boom" - perfect codes, incredible projects. In reality? It was more like "oops, I broke everything" several times.

My biggest challenges have been:

1. **Impostor Syndrome**: That feeling that I'm not good enough. Every time I see a complex code, I think: "Can I really do this?"

2. **Pressure for Results**: In the corporate world, you can't always learn at the ideal pace. Sometimes I have to deliver something I barely know how to do.

3. **Work x Learning Balance**: How do you keep studying after a full day of coding? It's not easy!

## Learnings That Are Worth Gold

But it's not all problems. I've learned incredible things:

- You don't have to know everything to start, mistakes will happen
- ASK FOR HELP! Seriously, it's not a sign of weakness
- Each line of code is a learning opportunity
- Debugging is the best professor you'll ever have

## Tips for Those Starting Out

I want to share some advice I would have loved to hear at the beginning:

- Find a mentor or network
- Do personal projects
- Don't compare yourself to others
- Invest in your constant development

## The Reality Behind the Screens

You know that image of the tech professional looking all stylish? My reality has a lot more coffee, debugging, and moments of "where's my error?!" ðŸ˜…

I could say something like "MY JOB IS AWESOME, LOVE IT FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART" but would be a lie. There's days that I want to quit and go farming, and that's okay. The important thing is to keep going.

## Conclusion: A Continuous Journey

Being a junior data engineer is like riding a bike for the first time: sometimes you fall, but you keep pedaling. And each fall teaches you something new.
